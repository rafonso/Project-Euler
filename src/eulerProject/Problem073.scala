 * Problem 73: How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in a sorted set of 
 * reduced proper fractions?<br>
 * 02 July 2004<br>
 * <br>
 * Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and 
 * HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.<br>
 * <br>
 * If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d <= 8 in ascending order 
 * of size, we get:<br>
 * <br>
 * 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 
 * 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8<br>
 * <br>
 * It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced 
 * proper fractions for d <= 12,000?</b><br>
 * <br>
 * Note: The upper limit has been changed recently.<br>
